# lets-get-functional

An exercise in problem solving in the functional idiom.

## Setup

0. If you haven't release your lodown library to `npm` (node package manager), follow the steps in this video to do so:

    [publishing-npm-packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)


1. **FORK** this repository on GitHub to your own GitHub account.

2. From your FORK, use SSH to clone the repository into a Blank Cloud9 workspace.

3. Once the Cloud9 workspace is finished initializing, from the bash terminal, run the command:

        npm install

4. Install your lodown library by running the command and replacing `<my-user-name>` :

        npm install --save lodown-<my-user-name>

5. Open up `index.js` and import your lodown library using the node `require()` method.

## Solve

Code and test your solutions in `index.js`. Customer data is available to you in the Array, `customers`. Utilizing your lodown library, write functions that take the Array of customers and return the following:

1. number of males.
2. number of females
3. oldest customer
4. youngest customer
5. average balance
6. how many customer's names begin with some letter
7. how many customer's friend's names begin with some letter
8. how many customers are friends
9. users have tags associated with them: find the top 3 most common tags
10. create a summary of genders, the output should be:

```javascript
{
    male: 3,
    female: 4,
    transgender: 1
}
```

Remember, in the node.js environment, you can both `console.log()` or use the dubugger to step through your code and inspect your work.
